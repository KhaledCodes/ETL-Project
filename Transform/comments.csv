Since I started watching you, you have literally brought me back to life.  I don't have instagram or anything and am probably too dumb to figure it out, but I love watching your YouTube Videos.  I have very limited funds.  Was almost homeless with my 10 year old but I have been slowly coming out of all of this.  I can now purchase at least one of your items.  I really want one of your mirrors but I think i will settle for one of your beautiful nude type lipsticks.  I just want you to NEVER change.  You are wonderful the way you are.  You are truly a special person!! You bring joy to so many people including myself!!  I never comment on anything but you give me such hope and inspiration that I had to!! Just keep doing you!! xxxooo"

54,"HUGE THANKS to ExpressVPN for offering all Food Ranger viewers 3 months free and 49% off their yearly package using this link: https://ExpressVPN.com/Thefoodranger . Travelers need ExpressVPN to stay safe online and to unblock any site. I personally use it for Netflix, even while at home in Canada, but also while traveling to unblock content and episodes that are geoblocked, and I also use it for security, because airport wifi and hotel wifi is often very insecure, leaving my data vulnerable. By connecting to one of their servers around the world, it’s just like my computer or phone is in that location, and all data sent while connected to their VPN is secure, safe, and private from others to see, so I know that my data won’t be hacked or looked at by others. Thanks so much for watching, and we have tons more videos coming up for you! Please leave me a comment below letting me know what you thought about this episode, thanks so much!!!"

64,"Saang station ka makakakita ng ganitong concept - na kayang pagsamahin sa iisang pamPaskong Station ID ang mga Christians at Muslims? Only ABS-CBN can do that and NO ONE ELSE CAN!!!

My VERDICT: I was expecting a full star power but they put more emphasis to the small deeds of people, which shows different concepts of Love. 
It's like:
50% - Star Power
30% - Christian-Muslim Unity
20% - Social Media Charity Wonders
If you're looking for a relevant, moving and sentimental but atmospheric CSID, then this is the one for you. 
All of the biggest, brightest and best stars are here already. 
Hindi nila kailangang magpaawa para magmukhang gumagawa ng ""charity deed"".
Hindi na kailangang i-announce na may gagawin silang ""charity deed"".
Kusa na lang iyon lalabas sa kanila. 

CONGRATULATIONS ABS-CBN for a JOB WELL DONE!!! You made me cry while watching your CSID."
